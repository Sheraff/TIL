Hey there! 

This mini-site is where I write down some concepts I come across and want to be able to come back to at some point. 

Or some fun things I learned. 

Or just things I remember finding out and getting excited or understanding something new... 

In the end I'm the main *user* as much as I am the contributor of this site. It's my notebook and I'm sharing it in the hope it's useful for other people. **And you should really do the same!**

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub]({{ site.github.repo }}).

## Other TILs

Many other programmers use the same concept of admitting they don't know everything to share cool nuggets of code.
